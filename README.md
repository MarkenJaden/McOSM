## Commands

There are several commands to load map data into minecraft, here are all of them:

* ```/osm``` or ```/osm [lat1] [lon1] [lat2] [lon2]``` to open the download and build gui
* ```/osmshell``` to start building the building right under you without a gui
* ```/osmfile [path]``` to open data from a file and open the build gui
* ```/osmapi [lat1] [lon1] [lat2] [lon2]``` to copy a link of the api url to your clipboard to manually open it
* ```/osm stop``` to stop all current tasks
* ```/osmcoords <to/from> <x/lat> <z/lon>``` to convert GPS coordinates to/from ingame coordinates

## Usage

* Go on a map (like Google maps), then find the latitude and longitude of the northwest and southeast corners of the area you want to download ([How?](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539)), and save those coordinates for later.

* Then run the ```/osm``` command which will open the builder gui

* Select the features you want on the left *(The [Global/Local] toggle changes the building placement from on the terra121 map location to locally around the player)*

* Then paste the latitude/longitude you copied from earler into coordinate boxes. the map preview should now vaguely line up *(**It doesn't enterly line up!** As long as it isn't on the other side of the earth it should be fine)*

* Then click the ```Download``` Button and wait for it to download, If it wasn't successful it should say an error in the output box

* If it successfully downloaded, you can click on the ```Start``` button to start building *(you don't have to be in the chunks its building in for it to build)*

**Important:**  
When using the mod in a Terra121 world, turn the map direction to upright and BTE projecttion!  
Also turn off roads and building outlines for the best result!
